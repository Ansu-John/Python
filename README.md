# Python For Beginners
Welcome! An experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may be) can pick up Python very quickly. It's also easy for beginners to use and learn.

## Learning
Before getting started, you may want to select the IDEs to use. I used Jupyter Notebook or Spyder which gets installed during [Anaconda installation] (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) during my initial learning and later [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for projects. Please find the list of Python IDEs in this [link](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors).
